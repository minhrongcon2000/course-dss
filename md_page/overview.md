# Data Science Course DSS

## Motivation

The motivation of this project is that the curriculum stated in the university website (see [here](https://it.hcmiu.edu.vn/bachelor-of-science-in-data-science-k21/)) is not logically arranged and organized, especially some key subjects such as probability and statistics and regression analysis. As a result, this site is made to provide a good constraint under the opinion of the author. Readers can also make a comparison and make a judgement for themselves. Detail on the flaw in curriculum design will be left for the readers to find out (because you are Data Scientists lol!). Besides, a decision support system is made within this project to help freshmen and sophomore choose their subjects wisely in the context of incomplete course design like this.
